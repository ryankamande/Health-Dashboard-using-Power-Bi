# Health-Dashboard-using-Power-Bi
## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Health Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard visualizes and analyzes health-related data to provide actionable insights for better decision-making. It is designed to help users monitor key health metrics, identify trends, and uncover patterns in the data.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic charts and graphs for exploring health data.

The dashboard utilizes data from:
- Public health datasets (e.g., CDC, WHO)
- Sample patient records (anonymized)
- Manually curated datasets for demonstration
